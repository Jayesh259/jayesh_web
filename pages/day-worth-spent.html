            <h1>Day worth spent</h1>

            <p>Recently I was wondering <strong>how can I turn a usual day into something worthwhile without putting in any special effort but through small things that compound over time</strong>. Time goes by quickly and life is brief. The goal is to make the most out of it</p>

            <p>Listing things that are on top of my mind:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Call parents - Be genuinely curious about their lives and stay deeply connected.</li>
                <li>Share and listen to close friends - Give love. Figure out ways in which you can. Do things that will compound the friendship and avoid things that will obstruct it.</li>
                <li>Read at least 20 mins</li>
                <li>Do 15 push-ups</li>
                <li>Go for a 10-minute walk</li>
                <li>Learn something new for half an hour</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I'll come back to the above list in a bit. Since a major part of my day goes into work, another question that arose while writing was <strong>how can I turn a usual day at work into something impactful without putting in any special effort but through small things that compound over time.</strong></p>

            <p>It's important first to ask - What will create an impact in the long term? I think that's - 1. Great customer experience, 2. Positive, truth-seeking and customer-first culture, 3. Great product, 4. Excellent team, 5. Efficiency and 6. Sustainability.</p>

            <p>Things that we can do to back these things</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Give genuine product feedback - Never be complacent regarding the product experience. Flag issues and ask questions to respective owners.</li>
                <li>Ask questions to yourself and others - practice truth-seeking</li>
                <li>Keep customer experience a top priority</li>
                <li>Aggressively follow up on important things</li>
                <li>Document and democratise learning</li>
                <li>Make a to-do list - improves efficiency (at least for me)</li>
            </ol>
