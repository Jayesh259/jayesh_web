# 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a personal website that closely mirrors the design, layout, and overall user experience of [saniyamore.com](https://www.saniyamore.com/). This website will serve as a comprehensive personal portfolio, showcasing your bio, work, writing, and other relevant links. 

Key objectives include:
- Replicating the clean and minimalist aesthetic.
- Displaying various types of content (bio, portfolio, essays, reporting, etc.).
- Ensuring responsiveness across desktop and mobile devices.

# 2. Core Functionality

1. **Home/Bio Section**  
   - A prominent introduction with your name, pronunciation (if you’d like), and a short description.  
   - Possibly an illustration or graphic that aligns with your personal brand.

2. **Portfolio/Projects Section**  
   - Listing your major works or research items, similar to “my crypto research” or “my reporting” sections on the referenced site.  
   - Each entry may link to additional details or external pages.

3. **Additional Content/Essays**  
   - A space for essays, blog posts, or other personal writings.

4. **Contact/Links**  
   - Clear ways to get in touch or follow you on social platforms.  
   - Optionally, a résumé button or section to showcase your professional experience.  
   - Social media icons and email link.

5. **Responsive Design**  
   - The layout should adjust smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.

# 3. Documentation

Below are general guidelines and notes to help you maintain and update the site:

1. **Design Consistency**  
   - Keep fonts, color schemes, and spacing consistent across all sections.

2. **Content Updates**  
   - For text changes (bio, project descriptions, blog posts), modify the relevant content sections in the HTML file(s).  
   - Update CSS styles if you add new sections or design elements.

3. **Asset Management**  
   - Store all images, icons, or other media resources in a dedicated folder (e.g., `images/`) to keep the project organized.  
   - Ensure file names and paths are correct and consistent.

4. **Future Enhancements**  
   - You may add JavaScript for interactive elements (e.g., a gallery, animations, or dynamic content loading).  
   - Consider adding meta tags and SEO elements in the head section of your HTML for better search engine visibility.

5. **Cross-Browser Testing**  
   - Test the site on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent styling and functionality.
